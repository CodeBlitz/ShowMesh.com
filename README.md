# ShowMesh.com
A movie timing website with API integration of Plex and IMDB database for providing recommendations based on
show subject time period meshing with today's date and time.

## Back Story
November 2019 I decided to watch a movie on my Plex Media server called Blade Runner. 
A great movie that feels modern even today. As I watched the movie introduction it stated
that the it is based in the future time period of "November 2019". At that moment, I realized that
the show had meshed with reality. Time and film were now aligned and it made what I was watching
even more interesting. In the past I would watch this movie and ask myself "Will these technologies exist in 2019".
However, now I was asking myself what they got right and what they missed. The moment of true appreciation
was the now and had I missed it I would have been dissapointed. These oppertunties to see a film
based in the future are fleeting. No person can remember the exact date and time for each
movie they may have in thier personal library, but it would be nice. So why not make it ourselves?

At that moment I decided to create ShowMesh.com to help mesh reality a persons media library.

## Goals
1) Provide an API to inform users which movie or show is ideal to see at the moment.
2) Prioritize show list based the value or significance of the timing. 
3) Include all media including such as movies and TV episodes and music (ex. party like its 1999).
4) Integrate with Plex so that users can choose to see what is appropriate now directly on the what to watch screen layout.
