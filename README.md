# ShowMesh.com
A movie timing website with API integration of Plex and IMDB database.

## Back Story
November 2019 I decided to watch a movie on my Plex Media server called Blade Runner. 
A great movie that feels modern even today. As I watched the movie intruction it stated
that this time period occurs in the future "November 2019". At that moment, I realized that
the show had meshed with reality. Time and film were now aligned and it made what I was watching
even more interesting. In the past I would watch this movie and ask myself "Will these technologies existin 2019".
However, now I was asking myself what they got right and what they missed. The moment of true appreciation
was the now and had I missed it I would have been dissapointed. These oppertunties to see a film
based on the time it was intended are fleeting. No person can remember the exact date and time for each
movie they may have in thier personal library, but it would be nice.

At that moment I decided to create ShowMesh.com to help mesh reality with our personal show library.
The goals are multifacited and described below.

## Goals
Provide an API to inform users which movie or show is ideal to see at the moment.
Prioritize show list based on the specific time period and relavence to the now (future events over similar dates etc). 
Include all media including Movies and TV episodes and even music.
Integrate with Plex so that users can choose to see what is appropriate now directly on the what to watch screen layout.
